# Finding-Heavy-Traffic-Indicators-on-I-94

# In this project, I analyzed a dataset about the westbound traffic on the I-94 Interstate highway.

# John Hogue made the dataset available, and you can download it from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume

# The goal of our analysis is to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on I-94. These indicators can be weather type, time of the day, time of the week, etc.
